This example demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to the + operator's behavior with mixed data types.  The `+` operator performs addition when both operands are numbers but performs string concatenation when either operand is a string.  This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution file provides a fix to address the problem by explicitly checking data types before performing operations.
